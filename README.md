# 🚗 Macro Cosmos Backend

The **Macro Cosmos Backend** is the server-side system behind Macro Cosmos — a full-stack platform built to improve routing and traffic efficiency in the City of Poway.

This backend handles routing logic, traffic data processing, and communication with the frontend and external APIs.

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Receives Requests from Frontend**  
   The frontend sends route requests, hazard reports, or user actions to the backend using HTTP endpoints.

2. **Processes Real-Time Traffic Data**  
   The backend connects with Google Maps and San Diego’s open datasets to calculate accurate and optimized routes.

3. **Returns Optimized Routes or Data**  
   Based on traffic conditions, user routines, or hazard locations, it returns optimized routing instructions or relevant data.

4. **Stores Data**  
   All hazard reports, user routines, and simulation settings are stored in a database using SQLAlchemy.
